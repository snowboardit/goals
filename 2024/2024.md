> 📝 **Note**<br>
> I really resonated with this article [_great engineer_](https://asuth.com/great-engineer) written by the creator of Quizlet, Andrew Sutherland. In my search to be a great engineer, I found this writing especially helpful. Although I may not have or achieve _all_ of the qualities listed in the article this year, guidance like this is important to keep in mind while working toward my goals.

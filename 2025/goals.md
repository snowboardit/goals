# âœ¨ 2025 Dev Goals

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Let me preface these 2025 goals by stating I understand the importance of _realistic_ and _quatifiable_ goals.
>
> That being said, not _all_ of the goals below will be quantifiable or realisitic... and that's okay.
>
> My thinking is this:
>
> - Aim to achieve general improvement is _acceptable_ ðŸ™‚
> - Aiming for one quantifiable goal is _ideal_ ðŸ˜„
> - Aiming for more than one quantifiable goal is a _extra credit_ ðŸ¤©
>
> Life has humbled me enough to know that if you set the bar too high, you are setting yourself up for failure and what sort of person wants that? Not me!
>
> With that out of the way, onward!
